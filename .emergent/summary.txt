<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack time-tracking application, transitioning from local JSON to Firebase with offline capabilities. The core functionalities implemented include employee and time entry CRUD operations, detailed statistics with salary display, and a robust admin panel. Significant effort was dedicated to UI/UX, incorporating dark mode, responsive design, and iterative refinements for features like break calculations and employee photo uploads. The latest development phase primarily focused on integrating NFC-based clock-in/out via an Electron desktop wrapper, along with various UI adjustments and theme persistence. While many features were successfully integrated, persistent issues with Firebase data synchronization (employees disappearing after admin operations) and the welcome pop-up's activation on manual clock-in remain. The project has also recently progressed into converting the application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a native app experience, and the initial steps for NFC tag enrollment are underway.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was a local JSON-based time tracking app with employee management, individual statistics, admin protection, and a modern, responsive design. This evolved significantly to:
-   **Data Storage**: Migrate from local JSON to Firebase with offline capabilities.
-   **Employee Management**: Visible employee list (green/red status); admin-protected CRUD with photo upload, separated Nom and Prénom fields, and a Genre (Gender) field.
-   **Time Tracking**: Modify clock-in/out times; auto-calculate duration; auto 15-min break deduction per 3 hours, up to a max break.
-   **Statistics**: Display employee stats including salary in FCFA; initial password protection for stats viewing (later removed for viewing, but retained for time entry modifications).
-   **Design**: Modern, responsive, light/dark mode with persistence, specific Tailwind CSS classes, purple theme, gradients, hover effects, SVGs, and a restored old employee card design with compact buttons.
-   **New Features**: NFC tag-based clock-in/out via PC-connected reader, triggering a temporary pop-up with employee photo/info and welcome/goodbye message, plus sound. Remove En ligne indicator. Allow showing/hiding Employee/Statistics sections in settings. Display 4 employees per row. Change estimated salary color to green in dark mode. Transform the app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a native app-like experience (no browser navigation elements).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Firebase Firestore (database with offline sync).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Recharts (data visualization),  (theme persistence).
-   **Desktop**: Electron and Node.js (for NFC reader interaction).
-   **NFC**: PC/SC NFC readers for clock-in/out,  (Python) for tag writing.
-   **Web App**: Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest and service worker for native app experience.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Firebase for data persistence. An Electron layer has been introduced to facilitate desktop-specific functionalities like NFC interaction. The project has been recently converted to a PWA.



-   ****: The FastAPI backend, managing API endpoints for employee and time entry CRUD operations, integrated with Firebase.
-   ****: The main React component.
    -   *Summary*: Renders the application, manages global state (dark mode, display settings), handles authentication and NFC interaction. Modified extensively for UI updates (e.g., En ligne removal, 4-column employee grid, native app styling), welcome popup integration for manual clock-in, and display settings logic.
-   ****: Application-wide CSS.
    -   *Summary*: Defines visual themes, including gradients and dark mode. Styles for NFC pop-up, and native app look have been added.
-   ****: Admin interface.
    -   *Summary*: Manages employee details (add/edit with separated name fields, gender, photo upload) and application display settings. Modified for new fields, display settings, and enhanced employee deletion logic (to include Firebase time entries) and improved confirmation dialog. Adjusted for dark mode styling.
-   ****: Displays employee statistics.
    -   *Summary*: Shows time and salary statistics. Modified to ensure correct salary color in dark mode.
-   ****: Firebase integration.
    -   *Summary*: Handles data interactions with Firebase, supporting offline capabilities.
-   ****: New component.
    -   *Summary*: Displays a temporary, personalized pop-up (employee photo, info, message) upon NFC tag scan or manual clock-in/out.
-   ****: New component.
    -   *Summary*: Orchestrates frontend-side NFC event handling and communicates with Electron.
-   ****: Local data persistence.
    -   *Summary*: Manages offline data with . Updated to include default display settings and support deletion of time entries associated with an employee.
-   ** (Directory)**: Electron application.
    -   *Summary*: Contains  (Electron entry),  (secure Node.js API bridge),  (NFC reader interaction), and  (audio feedback).  content was recently updated.
-   ****: New Python script.
    -   *Summary*: Created for preparing (writing data to) empty NFC tags for employee enrollment.
-   ****: Root-level package file.
    -   *Summary*: Manages Electron dependencies.
-   ****: Frontend public assets.
    -   *Summary*: Now includes , , , and the  directory for PWA functionality.  was updated to link these PWA-related files.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Firebase Persistence Issue**: Employees added via the admin panel disappear after closing the panel or refreshing, indicating an issue with data persistence or loading from Firebase.
-   **Welcome Popup Activation**: The welcome popup does not display when manually clicking Arrivée (Clock-in) or Départ (Clock-out).
-   **NFC Tag Enrollment Implementation**: The process for writing employee information onto empty NFC tags using the provided reader and the  script needs to be fully implemented and integrated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most immediate work involved several key areas based on user feedback:
1.  **UI Refinements & PWA Conversion**: The application was transformed into a Progressive Web App (PWA) to provide a native app-like experience by removing browser navigation elements. This involved creating , , , generating various icon sizes, and modifying , , and  to adopt native-looking styles for the header and employee cards, and restoring the user-preferred old employee card design. The UI now appears clean and without browser artifacts.
2.  **Employee Management Enhancements**: The  was updated to separate Prénom and Nom fields for employees and add a Genre (Gender) selection. Display settings (show/hide employee/statistics sections) were added, and the employee deletion logic was enhanced to also remove associated time entries from Firebase. The estimated salary color in dark mode was changed to green in .
3.  **NFC & Welcome Popup Debugging (Ongoing)**: Despite initial attempts, the welcome popup is not consistently displaying for manual clock-in/out events. Critically, employees added via the admin panel are not persisting correctly in Firebase, disappearing upon closing the panel, which directly impacts the employee list. The AI engineer is in the initial phases of addressing the user's explicit request on how to *enroll* NFC tags by creating supporting files like  and updating  to handle tag data.

<optional_next_step>
My next step will be to debug and resolve the Firebase employee persistence issue and ensure the welcome popup displays correctly for manual clock-in/out.
