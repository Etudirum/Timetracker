The previous AI engineer successfully established a time-tracking application, shifting from local JSON to Firebase with offline capabilities based on user feedback. The core work involved extensive React frontend and FastAPI backend development, including comprehensive CRUD operations for employees and time entries, and admin controls. Significant effort was dedicated to iterative UI/UX refinements, such as fixing time modification issues, enhancing employee editing, implementing complex break calculations, adding salary display, introducing a robust dark mode, and integrating employee profile photos. A critical platform-level bug preventing deployment was identified and escalated to . The latest development phase, which is currently ongoing, focuses on integrating NFC-based clock-in/out via an Electron desktop wrapper, alongside requested UI adjustments and theme persistence.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a local JSON-based time tracking application inspired by a provided image, featuring employee management (add, edit, delete), individual statistics, admin password protection, and a modern, responsive design.

Key evolving requirements include:
-   **Data Storage**: Switched from local JSON to Firebase with offline capabilities.
-   **Employee Management**: Visible employee list with status (green/red); admin-protected add, edit (name, position, hourly rate, start/end times, break duration), and delete functionalities. Employee profile photos for cards and addition forms.
-   **Time Tracking**: Ability to modify specific clock-in/out times; automatic duration calculation displayed in hours and minutes; automatic 15-minute break deduction per 3 hours of work, up to a defined maximum break duration.
-   **Statistics**: View employee statistics, including salary in FCFA. Statistics viewing was initially password-protected, then password removed for viewing, but added for time entry modifications.
-   **Design**: Modern, responsive, light theme with dark text, pastel colors, specific Tailwind CSS classes (, , , ), purple theme, gradient backgrounds for cards, hover effects, and SVGs. Implement a dark mode with persistent selection across sessions.
-   **New Features**: Integrate NFC tag-based clock-in/out via a PC-connected NFC reader. This should trigger a brief pop-up displaying the employee's photo, position, and a welcome/goodbye message, accompanied by a sound. Remove the En ligne (Online) indicator from the main menu.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>

-   **Full-stack Stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and Firebase (database with offline sync).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for styling and Recharts for data visualization (charts).
-   **Desktop App**: Electron and Node.js to create a cross-platform desktop wrapper for the web app, enabling native functionalities like NFC reader access.
-   **NFC Integration**: Utilizes PC/SC NFC readers for employee clock-in/out.
-   **Authentication**: Password-based admin access and specific feature protection.
-   **Frontend State & Persistence**: React's hooks for UI state management and  for theme persistence.

<code_architecture>

The application features a standard full-stack setup with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, now primarily utilizing Firebase for data persistence. An Electron layer is being introduced to enable desktop-specific features like NFC interaction.



-   ****: The core FastAPI application.
    -   *Summary*: Manages API endpoints for employee and time entry CRUD operations, integrated with Firebase, and implements business logic for break calculations.
-   ****: The main React component.
    -   *Summary*: Renders the overall application, manages global state (e.g., dark mode), integrates various sub-components, handles user authentication, and coordinates the NFC interaction. Extensive modifications were made to accommodate all user-requested features including UI updates and new components.
-   ****: Application-wide CSS styles.
    -   *Summary*: Defines the visual theme, including custom gradients, rounded corners, and provides the base for the light and dark mode implementations. Styles for new elements like the NFC pop-up have been added.
-   ****: Admin interface for employee management.
    -   *Summary*: Allows adding and comprehensive editing of employee details (name, position, hourly rate, work hours, break duration), and integrates photo uploads. Features updated dark mode styling.
-   ****: Displays employee work statistics.
    -   *Summary*: Shows detailed time and salary statistics using Recharts. Has undergone multiple revisions to correctly display salary (in FCFA), manage authentication for access (then removed, then re-secured salary display logic), and correctly apply dark mode. Resolved a critical import conflict with .
-   ****: Firebase integration service.
    -   *Summary*: Handles all data interactions with the Firebase database, supporting offline capabilities.
-   ****: New component.
    -   *Summary*: Designed to display a temporary, personalized pop-up (with employee photo, info, and welcome/goodbye message) upon NFC tag scan.
-   ****: New component.
    -   *Summary*: Orchestrates frontend-side NFC event handling and communicates with the Electron-based NFC logic.
-   ** (Directory)**: New Electron application structure.
    -   *Summary*: Contains  (Electron's entry point),  (to securely bridge Node.js APIs to the renderer process),  (for NFC reader interaction), and  (for audio feedback), enabling the desktop application and NFC functionality.
-   ****: Root-level package file.
    -   *Summary*: Manages dependencies for the Electron application, including Electron itself and other Node.js modules required for native features like NFC.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on integrating NFC (Near Field Communication) tag-based clock-in/out functionality into the TimeTracker24 application, specifically leveraging Electron and Node.js to create a desktop version with native NFC reader support.

This involves:
1.  **Electron Application Setup**: Core Electron files (, ) are being established to provide a desktop wrapper for the existing React frontend. A new root  has been created to manage Electron-specific dependencies.
2.  **NFC and Sound Management**: Dedicated Node.js modules (, ) are being developed to handle the low-level NFC reader communication and manage sound feedback for clock-in/out events.
3.  **Frontend NFC Integration**: The React frontend is being modified (, ) to interact with the Electron-NFC bridge, process NFC tag data, and trigger time entries.
4.  **Welcome Pop-up**: A  component and corresponding CSS () have been created to display a temporary, personalized pop-up with employee details and welcome/goodbye messages upon NFC scan.
5.  **UI Refinements**:
    *   The En ligne (Online) status indicator is being removed from the main menu.
    *   The dark mode styling for the  modal is being refined to ensure proper display.
    *   Logic for persistent dark/light mode selection (using ) is being implemented so the theme choice is remembered across sessions.

The immediate last action was updating  for dark mode, followed by a user prompt to continue, indicating the ongoing nature of these comprehensive NFC and UI improvements.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to complete the NFC integration by implementing the  and  components and ensuring the persistence of the dark/light mode setting.
