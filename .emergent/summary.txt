The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a time-tracking application to Firebase, integrated NFC clock-in/out, and converted it to a PWA. However, the development trajectory reveals a persistent struggle with the build and deployment process, particularly with the React frontend. Despite numerous attempts to resolve build failures (e.g.,  issues), the AI engineer resorted to directly modifying  for almost all subsequent feature additions and bug fixes. This approach, while delivering visible changes, signifies a fundamental breakdown in the project's standard React development workflow, making future maintenance challenging. The engineer iteratively addressed user feedback on UI, features, and persistent issues like Firebase data synchronization and specific button functionalities, often by directly manipulating the compiled output. The latest efforts concentrate on resolving register modification and admin login issues.

The application, named TimeTracker24, initially tracked time locally and evolved into a full-stack solution. Key requirements include Firebase data storage with offline capabilities, comprehensive employee management (CRUD, photo upload, separated name fields, gender), and flexible time tracking with automatic break calculations. Statistics must display employee data, including salary in FCFA. The UI demands a modern, responsive design with persistent light/dark mode, specific Tailwind CSS styling, and a 4-column employee grid. New features encompass NFC tag-based clock-in/out with a personalized welcome pop-up and sound, removal of an En ligne indicator, and configurable display settings for employee/statistics sections. Recent user feedback emphasized adding CSV and Excel export options to the register, making all register buttons functional (print, export, modify), improving the employee statistics design, enabling Enter key submission for admin login, and applying dark mode to admin sub-menus. The application also needed to function as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Firebase Firestore (database with offline sync).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Recharts (data visualization),  (theme persistence).
-   **Desktop**: Electron and Node.js (for NFC reader interaction).
-   **NFC**: PC/SC NFC readers for clock-in/out,  (Python) for tag writing.
-   **Web App**: Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest and service worker.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup (React, FastAPI, Firebase), augmented by Electron for desktop-specific NFC interactions. Recent PWA conversion involved new files in .



-   ****: This is the *most critical* file in the recent development. Due to persistent issues with the React build process (Craco), the AI engineer has been directly modifying this compiled HTML/JS/CSS file to implement new features (e.g., export buttons, period filter, employee stats design, admin login fix) and apply styling. This bypasses the standard React development flow.
-   ****: Edited to correctly point  to  for Firebase Hosting, and updated with SPA redirection rules and cache headers.
-   ****: A new file created to define Firestore security rules, allowing read/write access.
-   ****: A new file created for Firestore indexes. Initially contained redundant indexes that caused deployment errors; these were subsequently removed.
-   ****: The Service Worker file, repeatedly modified to force cache updates (e.g., version increments) and address caching issues that prevented new deployments from being visible to the user.

-   Complete the fix for the Modifier button in the register, specifically addressing the JSON parsing issue within .
-   Resolve the admin login issue where the Enter key does not submit the password.
-   Fully integrate and verify the NFC tag enrollment process for employees, including setting up employee-specific tag data.
-   Improve the design of the employee statistics section based on the user's previous preference (revert to older design or integrate user-provided images).

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most immediate work involves addressing specific functional bugs reported by the user after multiple deployment iterations. The primary challenge has been ensuring that code changes are correctly reflected in the deployed Firebase application, often due to persistent issues with the React build process and Service Worker caching.

Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on:
1.  **Fixing the Modifier button in the time entry register:** The user reported that this button was not working. The AI engineer has identified that the  function, when called via this button, was experiencing a JSON parsing error. The latest attempt involved simplifying the function call to pass only the ID, and the engineer is now debugging the  function itself to handle the ID correctly and ensure proper data parsing and submission to Firebase. This fix is being applied directly within .
2.  **Enabling Enter key submission for Admin Panel login:** The user noted that they had to click the Se connecter button, as pressing the Enter key after typing the password did not work. The AI engineer is diagnosing this as an event handling issue and plans to implement a solution using  to trigger the login function, also directly within .

The application is currently on version v2.2, which is displayed in the header. Significant prior work included correcting Firebase hosting configurations (), creating Firestore rules and indexes, attempting to resolve persistent React build failures (leading to direct  manipulation), and numerous UI/UX enhancements like adding export functionalities (PDF/CSV/Excel), improving the statistics display, and ensuring dark mode consistency across the application. Despite these efforts, the current issues indicate an ongoing need for robust frontend functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Continue debugging and fixing the admin login issue, implementing the use of  for password submission.
